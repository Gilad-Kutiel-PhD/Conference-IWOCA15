\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
	

\item
We emphasised the relation between 2-Convex Recoloring and a maximum packing 

\pause\item
We obtained the first approximation algorithm for general graph
\begin{itemize}
\pause\item
On the way, we improved the approximation ratio for paths 
\end{itemize}

\pause\item
We introduced a liner size kernel

\pause\item
Open question: is there a fixed approximation algorithm for k-Convex Recoloring, 
when $k > 2$, say 3 ?
