\begin{frame}{Optimal Retains-All Recoloring}

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Consider a convex recoloring 

\item  
Assume all (1 or 2) green vertices changed their color

\item 
Assume w.l.o.g that there is no green vertex in the output

\item
Then, we can choose a vertex that was green and switch it back (for free)  
\end{itemize}
