\begin{frame}{The Cost of Retains-All Recoloring}
\begin{itemize}

\item
A pair \emph{survives} if both vertices with the same color survive

\pause\item 
The cost of a retains-all recoloring is the number of pairs that did not survive

\pause\item 	 
In other words, the number of pairs minus the number of pairs that survive

\pause\item 
That is, we would like to \textbf{maximize the number of pairs that survive}
