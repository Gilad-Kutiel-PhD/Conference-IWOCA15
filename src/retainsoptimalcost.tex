\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf<1>
{A pair \emph{survive} if both vertices with the same color survive}

\item \textbf<2> 
{The cost of a retains-all recoloring is the number of pairs that did not survive}

\item \textbf<3> 	 
{In other words, the number of pairs minus the number of pairs that survive}

\item \textbf<4> 
{That is, we would like to maximize the number of pairs that survive}
