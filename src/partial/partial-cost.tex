\begin{frame}{Partial Convex Recoloring}
\begin{itemize}

\item
We accept a partial convex recoloring as the output for 2-CR  

\pause\item
The cost of a partial recoloring is:
	\begin{itemize}
	\pause\item
	the \# of vertices that changed their colors
	\pause\item
	+ 
	\pause\item	
	the \# of vertices that were uncolored
	\end{itemize}

\pause\item
We get ``refund'' if an uncolored vertex is recolored back to its original color 

\end{itemize}
