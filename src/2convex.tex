\begin{frame}{2-Convex Recoloring}
\begin{itemize}


\item
Input: a colored graph, at most 2 vertices with the same color

\pause\item
Output: (any) convex coloring of the graph

\pause\item
The cost is the \textbf{\# of vertices} that changed their color

\pause\item
The goal is to minimize the cost
